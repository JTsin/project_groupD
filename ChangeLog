Workplan

For Q1 and Q2 we will compare the temperatures over the whole data given (e. g around 50-70 years)

Question 1: Average temperature on a given day, in a Northern (Lulea), a central city (Karlstad) and Southern city (Lund) in Sweden. Compare - Florian & Marie-Anne
  To reach the goal we did:
    .) created a bash script (cleanup.sh) to structure our data (make average on that day each year, get rid of "noise" in the file) in order to be easily read by root
    .) implemented a root function (tempOnDay) to make a graph of a given city on a given day.


Question 2: Coldest day of the year in Umea (and Lund). Compare - Jakob & Jenny
  To reach the goal we did:
    .) used cleanup.sh file
    .) created a bash script (coldestday.sh) to get the coldest day of each year
    .) implement root function -> work in progress


Question 3: What is the relation between the average temperature in percentage per day in a moon cycle, compared to the percentage of the moon phase in Lund in 2014?
Plan for 3: 
1. Split year in moon cycles
2. Highest and lowest temperature per month > convert to %
Try to find a connection between the moon cycle and temperature peaks
  To reach the goal we did:
    .) create a bash script (moonTemp.sh) which mkaes a file containing the date, temperature in percent and the moon cycle status (percent)
        -> work in progress
    .) implement root function -> work in progress
