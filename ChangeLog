Workplan

Question 1: Average temperature on a given day, in a Northern (Lulea) and Southern city (Lund) in Sweden. Compare - Florian & Marie-Anne

Question 2: Coldest day of the year in Umea (and Lund). Compare - Jakob & Jenny

Question 3: What is the relation between the average temperature percentage per day in a moon cycle, compared to the percentage of the moon phase in Lund?

Plan for 3: 
1. Split year in moon cycles
2. Highest and lowest temperature per month > convert to %
Try to find a connection between the moon cycle and temperature peaks

We have written a bash script to clean the data files to obtain only the needed informations in new files (one per city).
We have divided the first 2 questions to work in 2 teams. Thanks to that results we will be able to start the question 3 all together.
